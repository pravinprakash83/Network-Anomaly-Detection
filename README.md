# Network-Anomaly-Detection

Introduction :- In the realm of cybersecurity, network anomaly detection is a critical task that involves identifying unusual patterns or behaviors that deviate from the norm within network traffic. These anomalies could signify a range of security threats, from compromised devices and malware infections to large-scale cyber-attacks like DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service). The challenge lies in accurately detecting these anomalies in real-time, amidst the vast and continuous streams of network data, which are often noisy and heterogeneous.
The traditional methods of network anomaly detection often rely on predefined rules or signatures based on known attack patterns. However, these methods fall short in detecting new or evolving threats that do not match the existing signatures. Furthermore, as network environments grow in complexity, maintaining and updating these rules becomes increasingly cumbersome and less effective.
