# Data description

## Basic Connection Features

Duration: Length of time duration of the connection.
Protocol_type: Protocol used in the connection.
Service: Destination network service used.
Flag: Status of the connection (Normal or Error).
Src_bytes: Number of data bytes transferred from source to destination in a single connection.
Dst_bytes: Number of data bytes transferred from destination to source in a single connection.
Land: Indicator if source and destination IP addresses and port numbers are equal (1 if equal, 0 otherwise).
Wrong_fragment: Total number of wrong fragments in this connection.
Urgent: Number of urgent packets in this connection. Urgent packets are packets with the urgent bit activated.

## Content-Related Features

Hot: Number of 'hot' indicators in the content, such as entering a system directory, creating programs, and executing programs.
Num_failed_logins: Count of failed login attempts.
Logged_in: Login status (1 if successfully logged in, 0 otherwise).
Num_compromised: Number of 'compromised' conditions.
Root_shell: Indicator if root shell is obtained (1 if yes, 0 otherwise).
Su_attempted: Indicator if 'su root' command is attempted or used (1 if yes, 0 otherwise).
Num_root: Number of 'root' accesses or operations performed as root in the connection.
Num_file_creations: Number of file creation operations in the connection.
Num_shells: Number of shell prompts.
Num_access_files: Number of operations on access control files.

Is_hot_login: Indicator if the login belongs to the 'hot' list, i.e., root or admin (1 if yes, 0 otherwise).
Is_guest_login: Indicator if the login is a 'guest' login (1 if yes, 0 otherwise).
